## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Design Token System (3-Layer)
```
Layer 1: Primitives (colors.css, typography.css, etc.)
    ↓
Layer 2: Semantic Tokens (@theme block)
    ↓
Layer 3: Component Tokens (@theme block)
    ↓
Usage: bg-[var(--color-bg-primary)]/90
```

### 2. Type Safety Pipeline
```
TypeScript Enums → Zod Schemas → TypeScript Types (inferred)
                         ↓
                 Python Pydantic Models (mirrored)
                         ↓
                 Validation Script (pre-commit)
```

### 3. Server Components First
```
Server Components (default)
    ↓ (only when needed)
Client Components ('use client')
    ↓ (for interactivity)
React Context (state management)
```

### 4. API Integration
```
User Action → Chat Provider → API Client → Zod Validation →
Backend → Pydantic Validation → Mock Service → Response →
Zod Validation → State Update → UI Re-render
```

## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Epic | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| Design token system conflicts | 1 | Follow exact my_flow_app pattern; test early |
| Docker networking breaks SSE | 4 | Test SSE in Docker; verify CORS headers |
| Performance degrades with scale | 5 | Implement virtualization; profile regularly |
| Deployment env vars missing | 6 | Document all vars; use .env.example |

### Medium-Priority Risks

| Risk | Epic | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| Enum sync breaks CI/CD | 1 | Add to test suite; fail builds on mismatch |
| Optimistic UI race conditions | 2 | Use message IDs for matching; implement queue |
| TanStack Query breaks state | 5 | Incremental migration; keep fallback code |

## Handoff to Scrum Master

### Next Steps

1. **Review All Epic Documents**:
   - Read each epic's detailed specifications
   - Note dependencies and prerequisites
   - Understand acceptance criteria

2. **Story Breakdown**:
   - Break each epic into user stories (8-10 per epic)
   - Write acceptance criteria for each story
   - Estimate story points (use Fibonacci scale)

3. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Epic 1 should be Sprint 1 (foundation is critical)
   - Aim for 20-30 points per sprint
   - Plan for 6-7 sprints total

4. **Team Communication**:
   - Share epic documents with development team
   - Conduct epic kickoff meetings
   - Clarify any questions before story breakdown

### Story Template

```markdown
## User Story: [Title]

**Epic**: [Epic Number and Name]
**Story Points**: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
**Priority**: [High, Medium, Low]

### Description

- [ ] Deployed to dev environment
```

### Recommended Team Structure

- 1 Backend Developer (Python/FastAPI expert)
- 1 Full-Stack Developer (can work on both)
- 1 UX/UI Designer (for Epic 1 design tokens, Epic 5 animations)
- 1 QA Engineer (Epic 6 testing, continuous testing)

**Minimum Team**:
- 2 Full-Stack Developers
- Part-time QA support
