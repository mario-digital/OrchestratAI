# Story 3.2: Enhance Mock Service with Agent Metrics and Realistic Logs

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** backend developer,
**I want** the mock service to generate realistic agent status updates, detailed retrieval logs, and proper cache metrics,
**so that** the frontend can test and display the agent panel and retrieval log panel with meaningful data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Mock service populates agent_status dict for all 4 agents in every response
2. Orchestrator status transitions correctly: IDLE → ROUTING → IDLE
3. Selected agent status transitions: IDLE → ACTIVE → COMPLETE
4. Mock service generates QueryAnalysis logs with realistic intent detection
5. Mock service generates VectorSearch logs with document chunks (80% of the time)
6. Mock service generates CacheOperation logs with hit/miss status (50% of the time)
7. Document chunks have realistic file names and content snippets
8. Cache metrics include cache_status in ChatMetrics
9. Token counts, costs, and latency remain realistic (matching Epic 2 ranges)
10. All generated data validates against new Pydantic schemas from Story 3.1

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Info
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Backend]
- Mock service location: `orchestratai_api/src/services/mock_data.py`
- Test location: `orchestratai_api/tests/` (create test_mock_data.py if needed)
- Schemas location: `orchestratai_api/src/models/schemas.py` (import new models)

### Existing Mock Service Structure
[Source: orchestratai_api/src/services/mock_data.py]

**Current Functions**:
- `route_message(message: str) -> AgentId` - Keywords-based routing (keep as-is)
- `generate_mock_retrieval_logs(agent, num_logs)` - Generic log generation (refactor)
- `generate_mock_response(message: str) -> ChatResponse` - Main entry point (extend)

**Current Metrics Generation** (Epic 2):
```python
tokens_used = random.randint(200, 800)
latency_ms = random.randint(800, 2000)
cost = round(random.uniform(0.001, 0.005), 5)
metrics = ChatMetrics(tokensUsed=tokens_used, cost=cost, latency=latency_ms)
```

**NEW: Add cache_status**:
```python
cache_status = random.choices(["hit", "miss", "none"], weights=[0.3, 0.3, 0.4])[0]
metrics = ChatMetrics(
    tokensUsed=tokens_used,
    cost=cost,
    latency=latency_ms,
    cache_status=cache_status  # NEW
)
```

### Agent Status Logic
[Source: docs/stories/epic-3-agent-log-panels.md#How It Integrates]

**Status Transitions During Chat Flow**:
1. User sends message
2. Backend routes to agent (orchestrator does routing)
3. Response returns with:
   - Orchestrator: IDLE (routing complete)
   - Selected agent: COMPLETE (finished processing)
   - Other 2 agents: IDLE (not involved)

**Example agent_status dict**:
```python
agent_status = {
    AgentId.ORCHESTRATOR: AgentStatus.IDLE,
    AgentId.BILLING: AgentStatus.COMPLETE,  # If billing was selected
    AgentId.TECHNICAL: AgentStatus.IDLE,
    AgentId.POLICY: AgentStatus.IDLE,
}
```

**Note**: The frontend will animate transitions (ROUTING, ACTIVE), but backend returns final states.

### Retrieval Log Structure (Epic 3)
[Source: docs/stories/epic-3-agent-log-panels.md#Mock Data Generation]

**Log Generation Pattern**:
```python
logs = []

# 1. Always include QueryAnalysis (routing decision)
logs.append(generate_query_analysis_log(agent, message))

# 2. 80% chance: Vector search
if random.random() < 0.8:
    logs.append(generate_vector_search_log(agent))

# 3. 50% chance: Cache operation
if random.random() < 0.5:
    logs.append(generate_cache_operation_log())

return logs
```

### Realistic Document Content Guidelines
[Source: docs/stories/epic-3-agent-log-panels.md#Mock Data Realism]

**Requirements**:
- Document snippets should be actual technical content (not Lorem ipsum)
- Use realistic file names: `pricing_faq.md`, `api_documentation.md`
- Similarity scores should cluster high (0.75-0.95) for relevant results
- Content should match the agent domain (billing → pricing content)

**Example Content Snippets by Domain**:

**Billing**:
- "Our pricing structure includes three tiers. The Starter plan at $29/month provides essential features for small teams. Professional plan offers advanced analytics..."
- "Subscription billing occurs on the first of each month. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time, with prorated charges applied to your next invoice..."
- "Payment methods accepted include all major credit cards, ACH transfers for enterprise accounts, and PayPal for international customers..."

**Technical**:
- "The REST API endpoint /v1/chat requires authentication via Bearer token. Include the token in the Authorization header for all requests. Example: Authorization: Bearer sk-..."
- "SDK installation via npm: npm install @orchestratai/sdk. Initialize the client with your API key: const client = new OrchestratAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY })..."
- "Troubleshooting connection timeouts: Check your network firewall settings. API requests timeout after 30 seconds. Implement exponential backoff for retry logic..."

**Policy**:
- "Refund policy: Customers may request a full refund within 30 days of initial purchase. Contact support@orchestratai.com with your account ID to initiate the refund process..."
- "Data privacy: We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 Type II standards. Customer data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data retention policies follow regulatory requirements..."
- "Terms of Service updates are communicated via email 30 days before taking effect. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of the updated terms..."

### DocumentChunk Generation
[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#DocumentChunk]

**Structure**:
```python
class DocumentChunk(BaseModel):
    id: int = Field(..., description="Chunk identifier")
    content: str = Field(..., description="Chunk text content")
    similarity: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description="Cosine similarity score")
    source: str = Field(..., description="Source document path")
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = Field(None, description="Additional chunk metadata")
```

**Generation Logic**:
```python
def generate_document_chunks(agent: AgentId, count: int) -> list[DocumentChunk]:
    chunks = []
    filenames = get_filenames_for_agent(agent)  # Domain-specific files
    for i in range(count):
        filename = random.choice(filenames)
        content = generate_document_snippet(filename)
        similarity = random.uniform(0.75, 0.95)
        chunks.append(DocumentChunk(
            id=i,
            content=content,
            similarity=round(similarity, 3),
            source=filename,
            metadata={"chunk_index": i, "collection": "knowledge_base_v1"}
        ))
    return chunks
```

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/15-testing-strategy.md]

**Test Framework**: pytest 8.0+

**Test File**: `orchestratai_api/tests/test_mock_data.py`

**Test Coverage Target**: 90%+

**Key Test Cases**:
```python
def test_generate_mock_response_includes_agent_status():
    """Test that mock response includes agent_status for all 4 agents"""
    response = generate_mock_response("What are your prices?")
    assert "agent_status" in response.model_dump()
    agent_status = response.agent_status
    assert AgentId.ORCHESTRATOR in agent_status
    assert AgentId.BILLING in agent_status
    assert AgentId.TECHNICAL in agent_status
    assert AgentId.POLICY in agent_status

def test_selected_agent_has_complete_status():
    """Test that the selected agent has COMPLETE status"""
    response = generate_mock_response("Billing question")
    assert response.agent == AgentId.BILLING
    assert response.agent_status[AgentId.BILLING] == AgentStatus.COMPLETE

def test_query_analysis_log_generated():
    """Test that QueryAnalysis log is always present"""
    response = generate_mock_response("Test message")
    # Find log with type matching query analysis pattern
    query_logs = [log for log in response.logs if "intent" in log.data]
    assert len(query_logs) >= 1

def test_document_chunks_realistic_content():
    """Test that document chunks contain technical content, not Lorem"""
    log = generate_vector_search_log(AgentId.BILLING)
    for chunk in log.data.get("chunks", []):
        content = chunk["content"]
        assert len(content) > 50  # Substantial content
        assert "lorem" not in content.lower()  # No placeholder text
        assert "pricing" in content.lower() or "billing" in content.lower()  # Domain relevant
```

Run tests: `cd orchestratai_api && uv run pytest tests/test_mock_data.py -v`

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/16-coding-standards.md]
- **Naming**: Use snake_case for Python functions: `generate_query_analysis_log`
- **Type Hints**: All functions must have type hints
- **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all new helper functions
- **Randomness**: Use `random` module for realistic variance
- **Imports**: Import new schema types from `src.models.schemas`

### Integration with Story 3.1
**Dependencies**:
- This story depends on Story 3.1 being complete
- Requires new Pydantic models: QueryAnalysis, VectorSearch, CacheOperation
- Requires updated ChatResponse with agent_status field
- Requires updated ChatMetrics with cache_status field
- Must validate all generated data against Story 3.1 schemas

**Import Requirements**:
```python
from ..models.enums import AgentId, AgentStatus, LogStatus, LogType
from ..models.schemas import (
    ChatMetrics,
    ChatResponse,
    RetrievalLog,
    DocumentChunk,
    QueryAnalysis,  # NEW from Story 3.1
    VectorSearch,   # NEW from Story 3.1
    CacheOperation, # NEW from Story 3.1
)
```
