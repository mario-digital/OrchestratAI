# Epic 6: Documentation & Deployment

**Epic ID**: ORCH-EPIC-6
**Phase**: 6 of 6 (Final)
**Timeline**: Days 26-28 (~11 hours)
**Status**: üöß Ready for Story Creation
**Dependencies**: Epics 1-5 (entire application complete)
**PRD Reference**: OrchestratAI PRD v2.0, Section 10 (Phase 6), Section 12

---

## Epic Goal

Prepare OrchestratAI for production deployment and portfolio showcase through comprehensive documentation, demo video creation, and deployment to Vercel (frontend) with optional backend hosting, creating a publicly accessible, interview-ready demonstration of modern full-stack development capabilities.

---

## Business Value

This epic delivers:
- **Portfolio Readiness**: Public URL to share in resumes, LinkedIn, and interviews
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Documentation enables others to understand and extend the project
- **Professionalism**: Polished README and demo video demonstrate communication skills
- **Deployment Experience**: Proves ability to ship production applications
- **Interview Leverage**: Each architectural decision documented for discussion

### 2. Demo Video Script (Detailed)

**Introduction (30s)**:
```
[Screen: OrchestratAI homepage]

"Hi, I'm [Name], and this is OrchestratAI - a production-grade multi-agent
customer service platform I built to showcase modern web development practices.

It's built with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 on the frontend, and
FastAPI on the backend, all running in Docker containers with hot reload.

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Desktop Demo (2m)**:
```
[Screen: Desktop three-panel layout]

"The interface has three main panels. On the left, we have our four specialist
agents: the Orchestrator routes queries, and we have Billing, Technical, and
Policy agents for different domains.

In the center is the chat interface, and on the right, we have real-time
retrieval logs showing what's happening under the hood.

Let's send a billing query..."

[Type: "What are your pricing tiers?"]
[Click Send]

"Watch what happens: The Orchestrator analyzes the intent, determines this is
a billing question with 95% confidence, and routes it to the Billing Agent.

Notice the agent status changes in real-time - the Billing Agent is now ACTIVE.

The retrieval log shows the query analysis, vector search results, and
document sources. We can click to view the full document."

[Click "View Full" on a document]

"This is a full RAG pipeline visualization - you can see which documents
were retrieved and their similarity scores."
```

**Mobile Demo (1m)**:
```
[Screen: Resize to mobile or open on phone]

"The design is fully responsive with a mobile-first approach. On smaller
screens, we switch to a tabbed interface.

[Tap Agents tab]

All the agent information is still available, just in a different layout.

[Swipe to Logs tab]

Same with the retrieval logs - everything adapts seamlessly."
```

**Technical Deep Dive (1.5m)**:
```
[Screen: Code editor - globals.css]

"Let me show you some of the technical highlights. The design system uses
a 3-layer CSS token architecture - primitives, semantic tokens, and component
tokens - ensuring consistency across the entire app.

[Screen: lib/schemas.ts]

"We have end-to-end type safety with Zod schemas on the frontend that mirror
Pydantic models on the backend. There's even a validation script that runs
in pre-commit hooks to ensure the enums stay synchronized.

[Screen: backend streaming code]

"The chat uses Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming, so you see messages
appear progressively, just like ChatGPT.

[Screen: docker-compose.yml]

"Everything runs in Docker with a properly configured network. The frontend
uses Bun for package management, and the backend uses uv for Python dependencies.
Both have hot reload configured for development."
```

**Wrap-Up (30s)**:
```
[Screen: Architecture diagram or README]

"This project demonstrates:
- Modern React patterns with Server Components
- Production-grade design systems
- Type-safe full-stack development
- Real-time streaming APIs
- Docker containerization
- And responsive, accessible UI

The code is on GitHub, and there's a live demo at orchestratai.vercel.app.

Thanks for watching!"
```

## Notes for Story Manager

**Key Considerations**:

1. **Documentation is Marketing**:
   - README is often the first impression
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include visuals (screenshots, diagrams)
   - Highlight unique features

2. **Video Production Tips**:
   - **Script it**: Write full script, practice before recording
   - **Audio quality**: Use decent mic, quiet room
   - **Pacing**: Speak slowly and clearly
   - **Editing**: Cut mistakes, add smooth transitions
   - **Length**: 5-6 minutes ideal (not too short, not too long)

3. **Deployment Best Practices**:
   - Deploy early in the epic (allows time to fix issues)
   - Use environment-specific configs
   - Test production thoroughly before sharing
   - Monitor for errors after deployment

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test on production URL (not localhost)
   - Use real devices (not just DevTools emulation)
   - Test from different networks (WiFi, mobile data)
   - Verify all external links work

5. **Portfolio Presentation**:
   - Add to personal website portfolio section
   - Share on LinkedIn with demo video
   - Include in resume (link to live demo)
   - Prepare talking points for interviews

6. **Maintenance Plan**:
   - Plan for monthly dependency updates
   - Monitor Vercel analytics for usage
   - Keep demo data fresh (update mock responses)

**This is the Final Epic**:
OrchestratAI is now a complete, production-ready, portfolio-worthy full-stack application demonstrating:
- Modern React patterns (Server Components, streaming)
- Production-grade architecture (design tokens, type safety)
- Full-stack development (Next.js + FastAPI)
- DevOps skills (Docker, deployment)
- Professional communication (documentation, demo video)

**Congratulations on completing all 6 epics!** üéâ
