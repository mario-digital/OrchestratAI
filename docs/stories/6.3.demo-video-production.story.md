## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story depends on:
- **Story 6.1**: Professional README exists to embed video
- **Story 6.4**: Vercel deployment provides live demo URL to mention
- **All Epic 1-5 stories**: Application features to demonstrate

### Architecture References

**Demo Video Guidelines** [Source: epic-6-documentation-deployment.md#story-6.3]
- Duration: 5-6 minutes (optimal for recruiter attention span)
- Show both desktop (3-panel) and mobile (tabbed) interfaces
- Include code walkthrough to demonstrate technical depth
- Professional quality with clear audio, no awkward pauses
- Include captions for accessibility and silent viewing

**Video Script Structure** [Source: summary]
1. **Introduction (30s)**: Who you are, what the project is, tech stack
2. **Desktop Demo (2m)**: Full user workflow showing key features
3. **Mobile Demo (1m)**: Responsive design demonstration
4. **Code Walkthrough (1.5m)**: Technical depth (tokens, types, SSE)
5. **Wrap-Up (30s)**: Summary and call-to-action

**Recording Best Practices** [Source: industry standards]
- Practice script 3+ times before recording
- Record in segments (easier to fix mistakes)
- Use USB microphone for clear audio
- Record in quiet environment
- Use 1080p resolution minimum
- Export at 8000-10000 kbps for YouTube

### Code Examples

**Detailed Script** (Introduction):
```
[Screen: OrchestratAI homepage]
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is OrchestratAI - a production-grade
multi-agent customer service platform.

It's built with Next.js 15, React 19, and FastAPI, showcasing modern
web development patterns including real-time streaming, type-safe
architecture, and responsive design.

Let me walk you through how it works."
```

**Detailed Script** (Desktop Walkthrough):
```
[Screen: Desktop 3-panel view]
"The interface has three main panels:

On the left: four specialist agents - an Orchestrator that routes
queries, plus Billing, Technical, and Policy agents.

Center: the chat interface where users interact.

Right: real-time retrieval logs showing what's happening under the hood.

Let's send a billing question..."

[Type: "What are your pricing tiers?" and send]

"Watch the orchestrator analyze the intent - it determines this is a
billing question with 95% confidence and routes to the Billing Agent.

Notice the real-time updates: the Billing Agent status changes to ACTIVE,
and the retrieval logs show the query analysis, vector search with
similarity scores, and the documents retrieved.

We can click to view the full document source."

[Click "View Full" button]

"This demonstrates a complete RAG pipeline with full transparency into
the retrieval process."
```

**Detailed Script** (Mobile Demo):
```
[Screen: Resize browser to mobile or switch to phone]
"The design is fully responsive. On mobile, we use a tabbed interface...

[Tap Agents tab]

All agent information is accessible through tabs.

[Swipe or tap to Logs tab]

Same with retrieval logs - everything adapts seamlessly to smaller screens."
```

**Detailed Script** (Code Walkthrough):
```
[Screen: VS Code - globals.css with design tokens]
"Let me show some technical highlights. The design system uses a
3-layer CSS token architecture for complete consistency.

[Screen: lib/schemas.ts]
We have end-to-end type safety with Zod schemas on the frontend
mirroring Pydantic on the backend. There's even a pre-commit hook
that validates enum synchronization.

[Screen: streaming endpoint code]
Chat uses Server-Sent Events for real-time progressive delivery -
just like ChatGPT - with automatic fallback if streaming fails.

[Screen: docker-compose.yml]
Everything runs in Docker with proper network configuration and
hot reload for both frontend and backend."
```

**Detailed Script** (Wrap-Up):
```
[Screen: README or architecture diagram]
"This project demonstrates:
- Modern React Server Components
- Production-grade design systems
- Type-safe full-stack development
- Real-time streaming APIs
- Docker containerization
- Responsive, accessible UI

Code is on GitHub at [URL], and there's a live demo at [URL].

Thanks for watching!"
