# Story 2.2: Backend Chat Endpoint with Routing Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** backend developer,
**I want** a FastAPI endpoint at `/api/chat` that receives user messages and returns mock agent responses,
**so that** the frontend can send messages and receive properly formatted, type-safe responses from the backend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. POST `/api/chat` endpoint created and accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/chat`
2. Endpoint accepts `ChatRequest` Pydantic model (message, session_id)
3. Endpoint returns `ChatResponse` Pydantic model (message, agent, confidence, logs, metrics)
4. Endpoint integrates with mock data service from Story 2.1
5. Endpoint validates request with Pydantic (returns 400 for invalid requests)
6. OpenAPI documentation auto-generated at `/docs` shows the endpoint correctly
7. CORS middleware configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000`
8. Endpoint tested with curl/Postman and returns valid JSON matching schema

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
- Story 2.1 created `models/enums.py`, `models/schemas.py`, `services/mock_data.py`
- `generate_mock_response(message: str)` function is available
- ChatRequest and ChatResponse Pydantic models are defined
- Mock routing logic handles billing, technical, policy, orchestrator keywords

### Backend Architecture Pattern
[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md#102-controller-pattern]

**Router Pattern:**
```python
# api/routes/chat.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
from src.models.schemas import ChatRequest, ChatResponse
from src.services.mock_data import generate_mock_response

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api", tags=["chat"])

@router.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat(request: ChatRequest) -> ChatResponse:
    """Process chat message and return mock agent response"""
    response = generate_mock_response(request.message)
    return response
```

**Main.py Integration:**
```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from src.api.routes import chat

app = FastAPI(title="OrchestratAI API", version="1.0.0")

# Register routers FIRST
app.include_router(chat.router)

# Then add middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/11-unified-project-structure.md]

**Create/modify these files:**
```
orchestratai_api/src/
├── api/
│   └── routes/
│       └── chat.py          # NEW: Chat router
└── main.py                  # MODIFY: Register router, add CORS
```

**Test files:**
```
orchestratai_api/tests/
└── test_chat_endpoint.py    # NEW: Integration tests
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

- FastAPI: 0.115+ (auto OpenAPI docs, Pydantic v2 validation)
- Python: 3.12
- CORS required for frontend at localhost:3000
- OpenAPI docs available at `/docs` (Swagger UI)

### CORS Configuration Details
Frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js dev server).
Backend runs at `http://localhost:8000` (FastAPI).

CORS must allow:
- Origin: http://localhost:3000
- Methods: POST (for /api/chat)
- Headers: Content-Type, Authorization (future)
- Credentials: True (for future session cookies)

### Docker Networking Note
[Source: docs/stories/epic-2-chat-interface.md#lines-62-70]

In Docker network:
- Frontend container can access backend at `http://backend:8000` (Server Components)
- Browser requests use `http://localhost:8000` (Client Components)
- CORS applies to browser requests only

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/15-testing-strategy.md#152-test-examples]

**Test Framework:** pytest with AsyncClient
**Test Location:** `orchestratai_api/tests/test_chat_endpoint.py`
**Test Type:** Integration tests (20% of test pyramid)

**Test Pattern:**
```python
from httpx import AsyncClient
from src.main import app

async def test_chat_endpoint_success():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
        response = await client.post("/api/chat", json={
            "message": "What are your pricing tiers?",
            "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
        })
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert data["agent"] == "billing"
    assert "message" in data
    assert "confidence" in data
    assert "logs" in data
    assert "metrics" in data

async def test_chat_endpoint_validation_error():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
        response = await client.post("/api/chat", json={
            "message": ""  # Empty message (invalid)
        })
    assert response.status_code == 422  # Pydantic validation error
```

**Manual Testing with curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are your pricing tiers?", "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"}'
```

### Improvements Checklist

All quality goals achieved. No improvements required for MVP scope.

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Verified test execution (10/10 tests passing)
- [x] Verified ruff linting (all checks passed)
- [x] Validated requirements traceability (8/8 ACs covered)
- [x] Assessed NFRs (all PASS)
- [x] Checked architectural compliance (fully compliant)

**Optional Future Enhancements (non-blocking):**
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware (recommended before production)
- [ ] Add request/response logging for observability (Story 3.x scope)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tests when LLM integration occurs
- [ ] Consider response caching for frequently asked questions (optimization)

### Security Review

**Risk Level: LOW**

No security vulnerabilities identified. The implementation follows secure coding practices:

1. **Input Validation**: Pydantic models enforce strict validation (type, length, format)
2. **CORS Configuration**: Properly restricts origins to known frontend
3. **No Authentication Required**: Appropriate for MVP scope (auth in Epic 4)
4. **No Sensitive Data**: Mock responses contain no PII or credentials
5. **Injection Prevention**: Pydantic type enforcement prevents common injection attacks

**Rate Limiting Recommendation**: While not blocking for MVP, adding rate limiting middleware is recommended before production deployment to prevent abuse. This is a standard production hardening step, not a security vulnerability.

### Performance Considerations

**Current State**: Performance is appropriate for MVP with mock data.

- Async handlers minimize blocking operations
- Mock data generation is lightweight (<1ms)
- Pydantic validation overhead is minimal (<5ms typically)

**Future Considerations**: When LLM integration occurs (Epic 3), monitor:
- LLM API latency (likely 500-3000ms)
- Token usage and costs
- Concurrent request handling under load
- Consider implementing request queuing or caching strategies

### Files Modified During Review

**None.** No refactoring or modifications were necessary. Implementation quality is excellent.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.2-backend-chat-endpoint.yml`

**Quality Score**: 95/100

**Risk Profile**: Low risk with 1 medium-priority future recommendation (rate limiting)

**Decision Rationale**:
- All 8 acceptance criteria met and validated
- Excellent test coverage (98.29%) with comprehensive scenarios
- Zero code quality issues (ruff clean, proper patterns)
- Full architectural compliance
- All NFRs pass (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
- Production-ready for MVP scope

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done**

Story 2.2 is complete and meets all quality gates. The implementation is production-ready for MVP deployment. No changes required.

**Next Steps**:
1. Update story status to "Done"
2. Merge feature branch `2.2-chat-endpoint` to main
3. Proceed with Story 2.3 (Frontend chat integration)
