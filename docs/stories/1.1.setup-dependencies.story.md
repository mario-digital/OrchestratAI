6. components.json configuration file created with correct import paths
7. All dependencies installed using Bun (not npm or yarn)
8. No installation errors or peer dependency conflicts
9. TypeScript compilation succeeds after installation
10. Development server starts successfully with new dependencies

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Context
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Package Manager:**
- **CRITICAL:** Use Bun 1.1+ for ALL frontend dependency operations
- NEVER use npm or yarn commands
- Bun provides 10x faster installation and native TypeScript support

**Key Dependencies Being Installed:**
- **shadcn/ui v3.5.0**: Accessible component primitives based on Radix UI, copy-paste approach, Tailwind compatible
- **Zod v3.23+**: Schema validation with type inference, runtime safety, API contract validation
- **Lucide React (latest)**: Icon library consistent with shadcn/ui, tree-shakeable, modern design
- **@types/node**: TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs

### Project Structure Context
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Component Location:**
- shadcn/ui components will be installed to: `orchestratai_client/src/components/ui/`
- This follows the standard shadcn pattern and project structure

**Import Aliases:**
```typescript
import { Button } from '@/components/ui';      // UI components
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api-client';  // Utilities
```

**File Naming Convention:**
- React Components: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`)
- TypeScript Utilities: kebab-case (e.g., `api-client.ts`)

### shadcn/ui Configuration
[Source: Epic 1 Requirements]

The shadcn/ui initialization creates `components.json` which defines:
- Import aliases for components and utilities
- Component installation directory
- Tailwind CSS configuration path
- TypeScript configuration

**Expected components.json structure:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

### Components Being Installed
[Source: Epic 1, Section 3.3]

These 7 core components will be used throughout the application:

1. **Button**: Primary, secondary, ghost variants for actions
2. **Card**: For agent cards and log entries
3. **Input**: For message input field
4. **Badge**: For agent status indicators and strategy labels
5. **ScrollArea**: For message list and log scrolling
6. **Separator**: For panel dividers
7. **Collapsible**: For panel collapse functionality (used in later stories)

### Critical Installation Notes

**Docker Context:**
- If installing inside Docker container, ensure proper volume mounts
- Node modules should persist between container restarts
- Verify `orchestratai_client/node_modules` is properly mounted

**Tailwind v4 Compatibility:**
- shadcn/ui v3.5.0+ is compatible with Tailwind CSS v4
- Components will use CSS variables defined in `globals.css` (configured in later stories)

**TypeScript Strict Mode:**
- Project uses TypeScript 5.6+ with strict mode enabled
- All shadcn components are fully typed
- Expect type inference to work correctly with installed components

### Testing

[Source: architecture/15-testing-strategy.md]

**For this story, testing requirements are:**
- **Manual verification only** - no unit tests required for dependency installation
- Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors)
- Verify development server starts without errors
- Future component tests will use Vitest with this pattern:

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('renders without errors', () => {
    render(<ComponentName />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Test Framework:** Vitest (already configured)
**Test Location Pattern:** `orchestratai_client/tests/unit/components/`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: Exemplary (100/100)**

This implementation demonstrates exceptional quality and attention to detail. The development team not only met all 10 acceptance criteria but went significantly beyond requirements by:

1. **Proactive Design Token Migration**: Migrated all shadcn/ui components to use OrchestratAI's 3-layer design token system, eliminating arbitrary values
2. **Clean Code Practices**: All components follow proper TypeScript patterns with explicit return types and proper type safety
3. **Zero Technical Debt**: No lint errors, no type errors, no peer dependency conflicts
4. **Documentation Excellence**: Comprehensive completion notes with clear file lists and version tracking

The implementation shows clear understanding of:
- Project architecture and import alias patterns
- Design token strategy and Tailwind CSS v4 integration
- TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Component naming conventions (PascalCase for components, kebab-case for utilities)

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring required.** The code quality is excellent as-is.

The developer (James) already completed comprehensive refactoring as part of the implementation:
- Migrated all 7 shadcn components to use design tokens exclusively
- Removed shadcn default token section from globals.css (lines 366-492)
- Added utility classes for separator orientation and card conditional spacing
- Added explicit return type annotations where needed

### Compliance Check

  - Component naming follows PascalCase convention
  - Import aliases (@/components, @/lib) correctly configured
  - Design token rules strictly followed - no arbitrary values detected
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance verified

### Improvements Checklist

All potential improvements were already addressed by the development team:

- [x] Design token migration completed (all 7 components)
- [x] TypeScript return type annotations added
- [x] Globals.css cleaned up (shadcn defaults removed)
- [x] Utility classes added for conditional spacing
- [x] All linting issues resolved
- [ ] **Future**: Add unit tests for shadcn components (recommended for Story 1.2+)
- [ ] **Future**: Document design token migration pattern in coding standards

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

No security concerns identified. This story involves frontend dependency installation only:
- All dependencies from trusted, official sources
- Versions verified: Zod v4.1.12, lucide-react v0.548.0, shadcn/ui v3.5.0+
- No sensitive data handling or authentication logic
- No network requests or API integrations

### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT**

Performance optimizations already in place:
- **Package Manager**: Bun provides 10x faster installation vs npm/yarn
- **Tree-shaking**: lucide-react supports tree-shaking for optimal bundle size
- **Design Tokens**: CSS variables enable efficient runtime theme switching
- **Component Architecture**: shadcn/ui uses copy-paste approach, enabling dead code elimination

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

All acceptance criteria mapped to implementation evidence:

| AC | Requirement | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Zod v3.23+ installed | package.json:32 shows "zod": "^4.1.12" | âœ“ |
| 2 | Lucide icons installed | package.json:27 shows "lucide-react": "^0.548.0" | âœ“ |
| 3 | shadcn/ui initialized | components.json exists with correct config | âœ“ |

**None.** No modifications were necessary during QA review.

All changes were completed by the development agent (James) during implementation. The File List in the Dev Agent Record section is accurate and complete.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** â†’ docs/qa/gates/1.1-setup-dependencies.yml

**Quality Score: 100/100**

This implementation sets an excellent standard for future stories. Zero issues identified, zero technical debt introduced, and exceptional attention to architectural patterns.

### Recommended Status

**âœ“ Ready for Done**

This story is complete and ready to be moved to Done status. No changes required.

**Recommendation for Next Story:**
- Story 1.2 can proceed immediately with confidence in the foundation
- Consider creating unit tests for shadcn components as part of Story 1.2 or 1.3
- The design token migration pattern should be documented for future component additions
