nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Two-step secure streaming approach prevents message exposure in URLs. StreamError properly wraps original errors without leaking sensitive information. SessionStorage used appropriately (not localStorage) for fallback preference."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exponential backoff prevents server overload (1s, 2s, 4s delays). 30-second timeout detection prevents hung connections. Cleanup functions prevent memory leaks. Malformed event handling (max 5 consecutive) protects against CPU-intensive parsing loops."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error categorization (5 error types). Automatic retry with intelligent fallback. Clean connection closure on navigation. Parse error tolerance (up to 5 consecutive errors). All edge cases handled gracefully."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code with JSDoc comments. Clear separation of concerns (StreamError class, error categorization, retry logic). Type-safe implementation throughout. Consistent error handling patterns. Excellent test coverage aids future modifications."
