# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Presentational components with no auth/data access. TypeScript typing prevents injection vulnerabilities."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lightweight components (~200 LOC). Hardware-accelerated CSS animations. No unnecessary re-renders or runtime overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal dependencies. TypeScript compile-time safety. Defensive coding for optional props. No error boundaries needed."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (JSDoc + inline comments). Configuration-driven design. Centralized color logic. Design token system enables easy theme updates."
