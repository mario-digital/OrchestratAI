# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.3
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)
# Powered by BMAD™ Core

schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Create TypeScript Enums and Zod Schemas"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 18 acceptance criteria met with zero technical debt. Exceptional code quality with comprehensive documentation. TypeScript compilation passes in strict mode. NFRs validated across all dimensions. No blocking issues identified."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Non-Functional Requirements validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zod schemas enforce strict validation. UUID format validation prevents injection. String length limits prevent DoS. Strict mode prevents prototype pollution. No sensitive data in type definitions."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zod validation is O(n) complexity, acceptable for API payloads. Type inference has zero runtime cost. No blocking operations. Bundle size impact minimal (~5KB)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Descriptive error messages via .describe(). Full TypeScript strict mode coverage. Boundary conditions validated. Schema validation prevents invalid data propagation. Zero compilation errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional JSDoc documentation on all exports. Single new dependency (Zod 4.1.12). Type inference eliminates duplication. Clean architecture supports future extraction to packages/shared."

# Code quality highlights
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptional JSDoc documentation on every enum, schema, and type"
    - "Proper use of TypeScript enums with string literal values"
    - "All Zod schemas use .strict() and .describe() for validation clarity"
    - "Clean type inference pattern (Zod schema → TypeScript type)"
    - "Appropriate validation constraints (UUID, string length, numeric ranges)"
    - "Zero technical debt - TypeScript strict mode passes with zero errors"
  architecture:
    - "Clean 3-file structure: enums → schemas → types"
    - "Proper unidirectional dependency flow"
    - "No circular dependencies"
    - "Self-documenting code with clear naming"
