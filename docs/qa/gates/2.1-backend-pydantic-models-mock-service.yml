# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive input validation via Pydantic. Message length constraints (1-2000 chars) prevent DoS. UUID pattern validation prevents invalid session IDs. No SQL injection or XSS risks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance characteristics. All in-memory operations, O(n) keyword matching where n is small, O(1) random selection, no I/O bottlenecks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Stateless functions with deterministic routing logic. Proper error handling via Pydantic validation. UTC timestamps prevent timezone issues. No external dependencies."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Outstanding maintainability. Comprehensive docstrings, full type annotations, well-organized test suite, zero code duplication, clear separation of concerns."
