# Previously identified issues (ALL RESOLVED):
resolved_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Tests pass in pre-push hook but fail when run in isolation (jsdom environment configuration)"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Added // @vitest-environment jsdom comment for clarity. Tests must be run from orchestratai_client/ directory or via bun run --cwd. This is expected behavior, not a bug."
    resolved_at: "2025-10-25T19:51:00-07:00"

  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "localStorage access in lazy initializer lacks SSR safeguard"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Added typeof window !== 'undefined' checks on lines 28 and 40 to prevent SSR errors"
    resolved_at: "2025-10-25T19:30:00-07:00"

  - id: "CODE-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "No error handling for localStorage exceptions (quota exceeded, disabled)"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Wrapped localStorage operations in try-catch blocks (lines 29-34, 41-45) with console.warn for debugging. Graceful degradation implemented."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - localStorage used appropriately for UI state only. No XSS vulnerabilities (React escaping). No CSRF concerns (client-side only)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lazy initialization prevents unnecessary localStorage reads, 300ms animation meets 60fps target. Minimal re-renders. Excellent performance profile."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✓ FIXED: Production-grade error handling with try-catch for QuotaExceededError and SecurityError (lines 29-34, 41-45). ✓ FIXED: SSR safeguards with typeof window checks (lines 28, 40). Graceful degradation implemented with console.warn for debugging."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code architecture, excellent test coverage (92.59% component, 86.7% overall), clear separation of concerns. Self-documenting code with TypeScript types."

compliance:

strengths:
  - "Excellent requirements traceability - all 19 ACs mapped to specific tests with 100% coverage"
  - "100% design token compliance - zero arbitrary values or direct Tailwind colors (verified via grep)"
  - "Production-grade error handling - try-catch blocks for localStorage with console.warn debugging"
  - "SSR-safe implementation - typeof window checks prevent server-side errors"
  - "Clean lazy initialization pattern prevents localStorage race conditions"
  - "Comprehensive unit test coverage (6 tests, 92.59% component coverage, 86.7% overall)"
  - "Proper separation of concerns - CollapsiblePanel is single-responsibility"
  - "Independent panel state management with isolated localStorage keys"
  - "Accessibility-friendly - uses shadcn/ui Collapsible primitive with keyboard support"
  - "Type-safe implementation with explicit ReactElement return type"
  - "Graceful degradation - component continues working even if localStorage fails"
