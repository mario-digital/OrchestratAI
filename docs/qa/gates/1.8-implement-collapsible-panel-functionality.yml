strengths:
  - "Excellent requirements traceability - all 19 ACs mapped to specific tests"
  - "100% design token compliance - zero arbitrary values or direct Tailwind colors"
  - "Clean lazy initialization pattern prevents localStorage race conditions"
  - "Comprehensive unit test coverage (6 tests, 100% component coverage)"
  - "Proper separation of concerns - CollapsiblePanel is single-responsibility"
  - "Independent panel state management with isolated localStorage keys"
  - "Accessibility-friendly - uses shadcn/ui Collapsible primitive with keyboard support"
  - "Type-safe implementation with explicit ReactElement return type"
