# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Presentational components with React XSS protection, no user input handling, no external data fetching."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient auto-scroll with position checking prevents scroll hijacking. Smooth CSS animations. No unnecessary re-renders. Component tokens enable CSS optimization."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for edge cases. Graceful degradation for optional props. TypeScript type safety throughout. All edge cases tested (empty states, long lists, multiline content)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation. Clear component separation. Consistent naming conventions. Design token system makes theming trivial. 100% test coverage for critical paths."
