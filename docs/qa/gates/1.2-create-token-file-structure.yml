# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - CSS design tokens are static compile-time constants with zero attack surface"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimal performance - CSS custom properties have zero runtime overhead, build-time processing via Tailwind v4"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TypeScript compilation passes (0 errors), CSS layer cascade prevents specificity conflicts"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - 3-layer architecture, comprehensive documentation, consistent naming conventions, extensible design"

  - "Perfect standards compliance (kebab-case naming, --token-* prefix)"
  - "All colors use pure hex WITHOUT opacity (AC 2 critical rule)"
  - "Future-proof design with 2 bonus token files (layout.css, opacity.css)"
  - "Comprehensive inline documentation explaining token purpose"
