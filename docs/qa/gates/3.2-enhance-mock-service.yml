# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - mock service only, no user input processing in production"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fast execution (0.26s for 64 tests), O(1) operations, no blocking calls"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Deterministic routing, proper Pydantic validation, graceful fallbacks"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, comprehensive docstrings, clear type hints"

# Test Coverage Summary
test_coverage:
  mock_data_module: "99%"
  total_tests_added: 35
  test_execution_time: "0.26s"
  test_pyramid_compliance: "Excellent - 100% unit tests (appropriate for this story)"

# Code Quality Highlights
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Realistic domain-specific content templates (156-216 lines)"
    - "Proper type safety with cast() for Literal types"
    - "Well-implemented probabilistic log generation (80% vector, 50% cache)"
    - "Clean separation of concerns with helper functions"
    - "Comprehensive docstrings and type hints"

  minor_suggestions:
    - action: "Consider extracting magic numbers to module constants"
      refs: ["orchestratai_api/src/services/mock_data.py:304, 311, 353, 356, 437"]
      priority: "low"
      note: "Not blocking - hardcoded values like [0.3, 0.3, 0.4], (3, 7), (0.75, 0.95) could be named constants for better maintainability"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider extracting content templates to separate module if they grow significantly"
      refs: ["orchestratai_api/src/services/mock_data.py:156-216"]
      note: "Current implementation is fine, but may benefit from separation at 2x current size"
    - action: "Add module-level constants for probability weights and ranges"
      refs: ["orchestratai_api/src/services/mock_data.py"]
      note: "Improves maintainability and allows easier tuning of mock data behavior"
