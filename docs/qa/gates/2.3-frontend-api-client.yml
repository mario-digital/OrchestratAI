  pyramid_compliance: "âœ“ Appropriate (100% unit for infrastructure layer)"
  coverage_highlights:
    - "All 8 acceptance criteria mapped to specific tests with Given-When-Then"
    - "Edge cases covered: timeouts, retries, all HTTP methods, error scenarios"
    - "Mock strategy: Proper fetch mocking with realistic async behavior"
    - "Test reliability: Appropriate timeouts for long-running retry tests"

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Full TypeScript generics usage for type safety"
  - "Clean separation: error classes isolated from client logic"
  - "Proper error hierarchy: ValidationError extends APIError"
  - "Stack trace preservation with Error.captureStackTrace"
  - "Resource cleanup: clearTimeout in all code paths"
  - "Development ergonomics: Helpful logging for debugging"

testability_assessment:
  controllability: "Excellent - configurable timeout/baseUrl, DI-friendly constructor"
  observability: "Excellent - dev logging, specific error types, contextual error messages"
  debuggability: "Excellent - preserved stack traces, request/response logging, retry logging"
